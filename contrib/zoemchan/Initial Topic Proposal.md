## Redlining’s Lingering Effect on STEM Education Access

When HOLC map borders were created in the 1930s, the neighborhood's residents' race/ethnicity was considered, with people of color, immigrants, and Jewish residents being detrimental to a neighborhood's ranking. Districts given a "D" grade were shut out from favorable loan terms and new housing developments which contributed to long-term disinvestment in their neighborhoods. Because race was used as a determining factor, redlining deepened neighborhood segregation and disproportionaltely impacted people of color. Today, the impacts of redlining have been widely studied in economics and related fields, with strong evidence indicating prevailing disparites in wealth, health, housing, neighborhood quality, and even school finance. Because U.S. public school funding is strongly tied to local property tax revenues, neighborhoods with historically depressed property values frequently experienced underfunded schools. Furthermore, it has been shown that schools located in formerly redlined areas have less access to resources and advanced coursework. This funding disadvantage likely constrained investments in science laboratories, qualified teachers, and extracurricular STEM opportunities, all of which are critical for preparing students to pursue technical degrees.

The long-run consequences of such disparities are visible in educational outcomes. Residents of formerly redlined neighborhoods exhibit lower rates of educational attainment and higher poverty rates decades later, underscoring the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage. In the STEM context, these patterns help explain persistent racial and ethnic disparities. According to the National Science Foundation, Black students earn about 9% of all bachelor’s degrees but only 5% of engineering degrees, while Hispanic students earn about 15% of bachelor’s degrees overall but just 11% in engineering. In the workforce, Black employees make up 12% of the U.S. labor force but only 7% of the STEM workforce, and Hispanic workers represent 17% of the labor force but only 8% of STEM occupations. These gaps can be attributed to unequal K-12 education with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights reporting that only 57% of Black students have access to the full range of math and science courses in high school, compared to 81% of White students. Because increased school spending improves long-run educational and economic outcomes, a claim can be made that historically underfunded schools in redlined districts are structurally disadvantaged in cultivating STEM readiness. I believe that historically redlined neighborhoods have lower modern-day STEM degree attainment rates compared to non-redlined areas, even after controlling for modern income and school funding.


## Notes

- redlining: after great depression, govt established orgs to help w refinancing mortgages. these orgs appraised neighborhodds for investment risk in the form of color coded 'residential security maps'
    - The practice of ranking neighborhoods as hazardous and credit-unworthy is referred to as “redlining,” after the color assigned to “D” grade neighborhoods on these maps
    - assessments considered neighborhood residents’ race and ethnicity, with the presence of people of color, immigrant, and/or Jewish residents typically considered detrimental. 
         - In particular, almost no neighborhoods noted to include Black and East Asian or Filipino residents received “A” or “B” ratings [6, 7]. 
    - Redlining deepened neighborhood racial residential segregation [2, 8], and Black and other prospective homebuyers of color were disproportionately shut out from favorable loan terms and new housing developments — contributing to long-term disinvestment in their neighborhoods 
- Recent research points to the persistence of present-day economic disadvantage in formerly redlined neighborhoods, including higher poverty, vacancy rates, risk of loan denials, subprime lending, and mortgage default, and lower economic mobility, homeownership rates, and home values
- present-day districts located in D neighborhoods have less district-level per-pupil total revenues but higher
per-pupil federal and state revenues than those mapped to HOLC A, B, and C security ratings. However, the differences in per-pupil federal and state revenues are not large enough to overcome the sizeable gaps in per-pupil local funding that favor those districts mapped to higher HOLC security rating
    - most of these schools qualify for Title I funding which explains why their federal funding is so high
