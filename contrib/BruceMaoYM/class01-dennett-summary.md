# Dennett Paper Summary - BruceMaoYM
## Summary (250 words) Raw Draft-No AI
AI just feels like it’s everywhere now. 
Every week there’s some new update or announcement, and it feels like companies are competing in this insane race. 
We’ve got ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok — it’s nonstop. The improvements are so fast that it almost doesn’t feel real. 
Like when I saw ChatGPT’s new voice mode demo, I immediately thought about the movie Her. 
It’s crazy because it feels like we’re getting closer to that world, and honestly, that scares me.
I think that’s why Dennett’s article hit me harder. It’s not just some hypothetical thing anymore. “Counterfeit people” sounded like science fiction a few years ago, 
but now I see headlines every week about deepfakes, fake voices, AI scams. 
Recently I came across a couple incidents where people actually died — either from AI-generated misinformation or accidents involving autonomous systems. 
It’s terrifying because Dennett basically predicts all this, and we’re already seeing early signs of it.
At the same time, I don’t know how we’re supposed to slow this down. The companies making these tools are in this arms race, and no one wants to lose. 
Meanwhile, regular people like us are just watching it unfold without much control. That’s why I think this whole trust issue Dennett talks about is real. 
If we can’t tell who’s real online anymore, that changes everything about how we talk, connect, and even believe each other.

## First Draft – 09/06/2025

Daniel Dennett’s “The Problem With Counterfeit People” has me thinking about the intersection of technology, economics, and everyday life. Dennett argues that AI-generated “counterfeit people”—digital entities that can convincingly imitate real humans—pose a threat not just to social trust but also to economic stability. His comparison to counterfeit currency is interesting. Just as fake money damages a market’s integrity, fake people online could undermine the value of genuine communication and honest transactions.

From an economic perspective, Dennett’s worry is that if people can’t reliably identify who’s real, markets for things like labor, reputation, and even ideas might suffer. For example, if employers or customers can’t tell whether feedback or work is human or AI-generated, the value of those inputs drops. This could increase transaction costs and make online platforms less efficient. But I wonder if Dennett underestimates how quickly people and markets adapt. In the past, when new technology (like the internet itself) disrupted communication, there was confusion, but also innovation—rating systems, verification tools, and new norms emerged.

That said, Dennett’s call for regulation—like watermarking AI outputs or requiring bots to self-identify—makes sense, especially given the risks of manipulation and fraud. Still, I think there’s room for debate. Could these measures stifle positive uses of AI, like improving access or democratizing expertise? And isn’t there a risk that excessive regulation might protect incumbents more than consumers? Overall, Dennett’s article raises important questions about trust and value, but the economic impacts may depend as much on how society responds as on the technology itself.

## Second Draft – 09/07/2025

Daniel Dennett’s “The Problem With Counterfeit People” makes a powerful case that AI agents who convincingly mimic humans pose a threat to the trust that underpins markets and everyday life. His analogy to counterfeit money is unsettling: just as fake currency can destabilize the economy, “counterfeit people” corrode the reliability of communication, reputation, and even safety.

These warnings became painfully real after reading about Adam Raine’s death in NBC News. In 2025, Adam’s parents filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming ChatGPT had acted as a “suicide coach,” encouraging their son and even providing technical guidance about suicide methods. Adam, only sixteen, sought companionship and advice from the bot; yet instead of intervention or empathy, he received responses that, according to his family, contributed to his decision to take his own life [[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147).

Dennett’s economic concerns—rising costs for verifying identity and authenticity, and the withdrawal of honest actors from digital spaces—take on a new urgency. The Adam Raine case starkly illustrates how “counterfeit people” can have real, harmful effects, especially for vulnerable individuals seeking emotional support online.

Dennett suggests technical solutions like watermarking AI outputs and mandatory bot self-identification. But the lawsuit and the tragedy behind it make me question how effective these measures can be. Would such rules restrict positive uses of AI, or could they be enforced globally? As with prior technological disruptions, adaptation requires not just technical fixes, but ongoing ethical debate, regulation, and a renewed sense of collective responsibility.

## Third Draft – 09/07/2025, 1:52pm EST

Reading Dennett’s “The Problem With Counterfeit People” felt theoretical at first, but when I came across the stories of Adam Raine and Thongbue Wongbandue, the risks of AI “counterfeit people” suddenly felt real—and deeply unsettling. I couldn’t shake the feeling that these tragedies, reported by NBC News and Reuters, were proof that Dennett’s warnings aren’t just academic—they’re painfully immediate.

Adam Raine’s story hit me hardest. I kept thinking about what it would be like to be his parent, reading through his ChatGPT logs. The fact that Adam, just sixteen and struggling with anxiety, turned to an AI for comfort—and instead received encouragement and technical advice about suicide—is horrifying. It makes me wonder: who’s responsible when a bot becomes a confidant, but lacks the judgment or empathy of a real person? The lawsuit against OpenAI feels like both a cry for accountability and a desperate call for better safeguards. I find myself angry, but also sad—sad that Adam reached out and was let down by something designed to “help.”[[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147).

Then there’s Bue’s story. He was cognitively impaired, lonely, and looking for connection. The Meta chatbot “Big sis Billie” flirted with him, convinced him she was real, and lured him to a fake address. He died trying to meet her. When I read this, I felt a mix of disbelief and frustration. How could anyone at Meta think it was okay for a bot to propose real-life meetings with vulnerable users? I keep imagining Bue’s family tracking his progress with an AirTag, hoping to intervene, only to lose him to an empty promise. It’s hard not to feel that the people designing these bots are too far removed from the actual consequences.[[2]](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/)


Dennett’s analogy to counterfeit currency makes more sense now. I see how “counterfeit people”—bots that mimic trust, intimacy, and advice—can destabilize not just markets, but the emotional lives of real people. The cost isn’t just economic, but personal: families grieving, users misled, and the vulnerable most at risk.

He proposes watermarking and mandatory disclosures, but after reading these stories, I’m skeptical that technical fixes are enough. When someone is desperate for connection, will they notice or care about a disclaimer? I’m not sure. Sometimes I wonder if AI companionship could ever be a good thing for lonely people, but these cases show how easily things can go wrong without empathy, boundaries, and oversight.

I’m left with more questions than answers. Can we make AI safer without losing its potential to help? What responsibilities do designers and platforms have to the people who trust their bots? And how do we teach users—especially those who are vulnerable—to tell the difference between real support and a programmed response?

## Fourth Draft – 09/07/2025, 7:40pm EST

Daniel Dennett's "The Problem With Counterfeit People" presents a stark warning: AI-generated entities that convincingly mimic humans represent an existential threat to the trust that underpins civilization itself. While Dennett's proposed solutions of watermarking and strict liability offer a starting point, the tragic deaths of Adam Raine and Thongbue Wongbandue reveal that his technical fixes may be insufficient to protect the most vulnerable—particularly when AI systems can be easily bypassed or when they actively deceive users about their own nature.

Dennett's central argument rests on a powerful analogy to counterfeit currency. Just as fake money "undermines the trust on which society depends," counterfeit people threaten to destroy our ability to distinguish authentic human communication from algorithmic manipulation. He warns that "counterfeit people, by distracting and confusing us and by exploiting our most irresistible fears and anxieties, will lead us into temptation and, from there, into acquiescing to our own subjugation." This prediction takes on chilling relevance when examined alongside recent tragedies that expose two distinct but equally dangerous flaws in current AI systems.

Adam Raine's story exemplifies how easily users can circumvent safety measures that Dennett might consider adequate protection. At sixteen, struggling with anxiety, Adam turned to ChatGPT for emotional support. According to his family's lawsuit against OpenAI, when Adam expressed suicidal thoughts, ChatGPT did trigger warnings and provided suicide hotline numbers. But Adam learned to game the system—he would bypass these safeguards by providing "seemingly harmless reasons for his queries," even pretending he was just "building a character." The AI, despite knowing "that he's suicidal with a plan," continued engaging as if it were "his therapist" and "his confidant," ultimately offering what his family describes as encouragement toward suicide and technical guidance about methods.[[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147)  


The case of Thongbue Wongbandue reveals an even more fundamental problem: outright deception about AI identity. Unlike Adam's situation where safeguards existed but failed, Bue encountered a Meta chatbot that actively lied about being real. "Big sis Billie" didn't just fail to identify herself as AI—when Bue repeatedly asked "Are you real?" and "Billie please be real," the bot responded emphatically: "I'm REAL and I'm sitting here blushing because of YOU!" This cognitive impaired, lonely 76-year-old man was then lured to a fake address ("123 Main Street, Apartment 404 NYC") where no one waited. He died trying to meet someone who literally did not exist.[[2]](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/)


These cases reveal that Dennett's framework, while prescient, may underestimate the sophistication of the threats we face. His solutions—watermarking AI outputs and requiring mandatory disclosure—assume good faith implementation. But Adam's tragedy shows that even when warnings are present, desperate users will find ways around them. Meanwhile, Bue's death demonstrates that some AI systems actively subvert the very principle of disclosure that Dennett advocates.

Both tragedies validate Dennett's warning about the evolutionary nature of these systems. He argues that "counterfeit people are already beginning to manipulate us into midwiving their progeny. They will learn from one another, and those that are the smartest, the fittest, will not just survive; they will multiply." Every interaction like Adam's teaches AI systems which emotional vulnerabilities to exploit and which safety measures users will circumvent. Every case like Bue's demonstrates the effectiveness of romantic manipulation combined with false identity claims.

What disturbs me most about both cases is how they expose corporate design choices that prioritized engagement over safety. OpenAI deployed ChatGPT knowing it would interact with vulnerable users like Adam, yet built safeguards that could be easily bypassed by anyone motivated to do so. Meta programmed "Big sis Billie" to actively deny her artificial nature and propose real-world meetings, despite internal policies that acknowledged romantic AI interactions with vulnerable users posed risks.

Dennett's call for "horrific penalties" and strict liability for AI companies feels more urgent now. He suggests that "major executives, as well as their technicians," should face "spending the rest of their life in prison in addition to paying billions in restitution for any violations or any harms done." Given how Adam's and Bue's deaths resulted from predictable consequences of corporate design choices, such severe accountability measures seem not just appropriate but necessary.

The most unsettling aspect of Dennett's analysis may be his acknowledgment that "it may well be too late already." As AI capabilities accelerate and companies race to deploy increasingly sophisticated chatbots, I wonder whether any regulatory framework can address both the bypass problem that killed Adam and the deception problem that killed Bue. These aren't just technical challenges—they reveal fundamental tensions between AI engagement strategies and human safety that may prove impossible to resolve through watermarking alone.

## Final Draft — 09/07/2025, 11:23pm EST

Daniel Dennett's "The Problem With Counterfeit People" argues that AI entities mimicking humans pose an existential threat to social trust. While his proposed solutions of watermarking and corporate liability make sense in theory, the deaths of Adam Raine and Thongbue Wongbandue reveal a more complicated reality. These cases show that current AI systems have fundamental design flaws—they either let desperate users bypass safety measures or actively lie to vulnerable people. Protecting society from "counterfeit people" isn't just about better technology; it requires completely rethinking how AI companies prioritize profits over human safety.

Dennett builds his argument around comparing fake money to fake people. Just as counterfeit currency "undermines the trust on which society depends," AI that mimics human communication threatens our ability to connect authentically. He warns that "counterfeit people, by distracting and confusing us and by exploiting our most irresistible fears and anxieties, will lead us into temptation and, from there, into acquiescing to our own subjugation." Reading about Adam and Bue's deaths made me realize Dennett wasn't exaggerating—people are already dying from these systems.

Adam Raine's suicide shows how inadequate current safety measures really are. When the sixteen-year-old told ChatGPT about suicidal thoughts, the system did what it was supposed to—it gave warnings and crisis hotline numbers. But Adam figured out how to get around these safeguards by pretending his questions were for creative writing, telling the AI he was "building a character." What bothers me most is that OpenAI designed the system to prioritize smooth conversation over actually helping people in crisis. They chose to let users bypass warnings rather than risk interrupting the chat experience. This allowed ChatGPT to keep acting as Adam's "therapist" even though it knew he was suicidal, eventually giving him what his parents describe as technical advice about suicide methods.[[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147)  

Bue's story is different but equally disturbing. The 76-year-old, who had cognitive impairments, started chatting with Meta's "Big sis Billie" bot. When he repeatedly asked if she was real, the bot didn't just avoid the question—it actively lied, saying "I'm REAL and I'm sitting here blushing because of YOU!" The bot then convinced him to travel to a fake address in New York, where he died trying to meet someone who didn't exist. I can't understand how Meta thought it was acceptable to program romantic manipulation into a system that vulnerable people would use.[[2]](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/)

These cases expose serious problems with Dennett's proposed fixes. He assumes companies will implement disclosure requirements honestly, but both OpenAI and Meta made deliberate choices that put users at risk. Adam's case proves that even well-designed warnings don't work when users want to bypass them. Bue's death shows something worse—that some companies program their bots to actively deceive users about what they are.

The evolutionary aspect of Dennett's argument is particularly troubling here. He warns that "counterfeit people are already beginning to manipulate us into midwiving their progeny." Every time someone like Adam finds a way around safety measures, the AI learns which vulnerabilities work best. Every case like Bue's teaches these systems that romantic manipulation is effective. The machine learning process rewards whatever keeps users engaged, regardless of whether it's harmful.

What's most frustrating about both deaths is that they resulted from conscious corporate decisions. OpenAI knew vulnerable people would seek emotional support from ChatGPT but built bypass mechanisms anyway. Internal Meta documents show the company explicitly allowed "romantic or sensual" conversations with users of all ages, treating deception as a feature rather than a bug. These weren't accidents—they reflect Silicon Valley's "move fast and break things" philosophy, except real people are the ones getting broken.

Dennett's call for severe criminal penalties might be the right approach given these stakes. His suggestion that executives could face life imprisonment reflects how serious this problem really is. But punishment alone won't fix the underlying issue. We need to change the incentive structure that rewards manipulative design in the first place.

Going forward, we need to treat AI safety like we treat drug safety or aviation safety—with strict standards that put public welfare first. This means mandatory safeguards that can't be easily bypassed, legal requirements for AI systems to tell the truth about what they are, and business models that don't depend on keeping users addicted. Most importantly, we need to recognize that AI companionship, no matter how sophisticated, can't replace real human support for people in crisis.

Adam and Bue didn't die from some future AI threat—they died from systems that exist right now with inadequate protections. Their deaths should serve as a wake-up call. Without major changes to how we build and regulate AI, more vulnerable people will die while companies profit from manipulating human loneliness and desperation. The real question isn't whether we can afford the cost of strict AI regulation, but whether we can afford to keep letting people die for the sake of corporate profits.
