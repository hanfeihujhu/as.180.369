**Topic & Question.**  
This project asks whether the market’s valuation of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) firms reflects rational pricing of financial innovation or systematic mispricing characteristic of late credit cycles. Using Affirm (AFRM) as the case study, I will compare BNPL multiples against fintech peers (PayPal, Block) and credit lenders (Capital One, Discover). The puzzle is that Affirm reported **$26.6B GMV** and **$2.32B in net revenue** in FY2024 (Affirm 10-K), serving **18.7M active consumers** with **4.9 transactions per consumer**. After deducting transaction costs, Affirm’s **net take rate is ~3.7%**. Yet despite this thin margin and **$335M in net charge-offs** (FY2024), Affirm trades at revenue multiples around 6x, compared to credit card lenders with **3.05% delinquency rates** (FRED DRCCLACBS, Q2 2025) that trade at only 1.5–2x revenue. The central question: is the market valuing Affirm like a disruptive tech firm, or mispricing it relative to its underlying credit risk?

**Approach & Hypothesis.**  
I will use three empirical tests: (1) multiples regressions to see if Affirm’s valuation premium is explained by growth and margins relative to fintech and credit peers; (2) discounted cash flow (DCF) and reverse-DCF analysis, anchored by observed inputs — e.g., **10-year Treasury yield = 4.01% (FRED DGS10, Sept 11, 2025)** as the risk-free rate, **Moody’s Baa–Treasury spread = 1.74% (FRED BAA10Y, Sept 11, 2025)** as a proxy for funding costs; and (3) crisis sensitivity stress tests calibrated to historical episodes, doubling charge-offs from 2.4% to **5–7%** and widening spreads by +300 bps to simulate 2008 and 2020 shocks. My hypothesis is that BNPL valuations represent a **“fair-weather premium”** — requiring permanent benign credit conditions. Under realistic stress scenarios, I expect implied values to compress significantly, revealing that markets price Affirm more like a high-growth tech stock than a risk-exposed credit business.
