\f0\fs24 \cf0 I would like to focus my paper on the effects of environmental regulations on affordable housing supply. In recent years, there has been a big debate over whether environmental regulations such as those in California are limiting affordable housing, and one of said laws (CEQA - California Environmental Quality Act) was recently repealed. I would like to explore this topic in my paper, perhaps focusing on California as a case study. I could compare California\'92s problems with building affordable housing with those of states with weaker environmental regulations. I am interested in studying the trade-offs between these policies\'92 environmental benefits and their housing-supply downsides. It might also be interesting to explore the specific interest groups supporting these policies and why CEQA stayed in effect for so long despite significant opposition.\

My initial hypothesis is that overly strict environmental regulations have led to a decreased housing supply and therefore led to higher housing prices in California and other states. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis is that the environmental laws have had very little effect on the housing supply, and the low levels of affordable housing are due to other factors. There are bound to be many confounding variables when comparing different states with vastly different economic circumstances.}
