GPT: 1. Integrating AI into Economic Workflows
Korinek emphasizes that generative AI, particularly large language models, can serve as powerful assistants that automate the “micro-tasks” which cumulatively occupy much of an economist’s time. By handling ideation, feedback, background research, coding, and even preliminary mathematical derivations, AI enables economists to focus on higher-level reasoning and synthesis. This division of labor reflects Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage: AI excels at generating and processing content rapidly, while humans retain an edge in judgment, context, and evaluation. As AI capabilities scale predictably with computational power and data, its role in augmenting productivity will deepen, reshaping how research is conceived and executed.

2. Risks and Epistemic Challenges
Despite its promise, Korinek warns that generative AI’s power to produce fluent but potentially erroneous text requires economists to maintain critical oversight. Hallucination, bias reproduction, and over-confidence in machine output could distort empirical or theoretical work if unchecked. Moreover, widespread dependence on the same few models risks homogenizing ideas, narrowing academic diversity. Thus, while AI offers intellectual amplification, it also imposes epistemic hazards that call for new research norms emphasizing verification, transparency, and methodological pluralism.

3. Long-Run Implications for Economic Research
Korinek situates these developments within a broader trajectory of “cognitive automation.” In the medium term, economists may increasingly delegate writing and analytical generation to AI systems, shifting human focus toward organizing projects and evaluating output. In the long run, he suggests, AI might independently generate publishable research, challenging traditional notions of authorship, creativity, and the value of cognitive labor. This prospective transformation underscores both the economic and philosophical stakes of AI integration—raising questions about productivity, inequality among researchers, and the evolving boundary between human and machine cognition.

Revision 1:
Korinek argues that generative AI, especially large language models, can transform economic research by automating numerous cognitive micro-tasks—from brainstorming and coding to writing and data analysis—allowing economists to focus on higher-level reasoning and evaluation ￼. He frames this as a modern extension of Ricardo’s comparative advantage, where AI specializes in generation and humans in judgment. Yet, Korinek cautions that overreliance risks errors, bias, and intellectual homogenization, demanding careful verification and critical oversight. Looking ahead, he foresees a gradual shift toward “cognitive automation,” in which AI systems increasingly produce substantive research outputs, potentially redefining productivity, creativity, and the role of human expertise in economics.
